# My first full stack Java project!

In this project I've used React to frontend and Spring to backend.
A data base was made to store users's info and movies ratting.
The DB is stored in Heroku, and the site is hosted in Nelify domain.
An Axios request transforms the website request into a JSON, that is stored in the DB.
Feel free to test and give hints!

Hope to improve my learning, and I prefer backend, wich is the area that I'll focus from now.
