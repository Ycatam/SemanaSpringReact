# My first full stack Java project!

In this project I've used React to frontend and Spring to backend.
A data base was made to store users's info and movies ratting.
The DB is stored in Heroku, and the site is hosted in Nelify domain.
An Axios request transforms the website request into a JSON, that is stored in the DB.
Feel free to test and give hints!

Send me a message if you want to test the site, because my Heroku is a free version, so I need to be logged to the DB works. the url is https://dsmovierafaelribeiro.netlify.app Hope you like it.

Hope to improve my learning, and I prefer backend, wich is the area that I'll focus from now.

Best regards!
